When the event is triggered (i.e. a key is pressed while the element has focus), 
the code checks if the input value of the "input_search" element is not empty.
If it's not empty, it shows an HTML element with the ID "closeSearch" by setting its 
"display" CSS property to "block". If the input value is empty, 
it hides the "closeSearch" element by setting its "display" property to "none".
